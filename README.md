# ExcelDataCollectionParser

<p>Custom processing for excel data in varying formats across excel files. The data included is simplified sample data, and any data existing is generated randomly and/or ad-hoc. While the data might not be as it was in the real use case, it is representative and the functionality of the notebook (and helper functions) works the same.</p>

<p>The results folder contains all of the csv files as parsed from the source, but the important collated and tidy csv is final_output.csv at the top level here.</p>
